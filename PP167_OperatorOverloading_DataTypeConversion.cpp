//We can use variables of different datatypes in the same expressions e.g. float with integer or an integer with a double. In these cases, C++ automatically converts one data types to another as the situation demands. the data type of the right-hand side operand or expression is concverted to the type of the left-hand side. Thus , Conversion from one data type into another is known as data type conversion. In C__, not only from one basic data type to another basic data type, we can convert from one class type to another basic type or vice versa, from one class type to another class type aslo. Basically, we can have following type of conversions

/*
1) Conversion from basic type to another basic type.
2) Conversion from class type to basic type and vice-versa
3) Conversion from one class type to another class type.
*/

// Conversion from basic type to another basic type_info
/*
We know that data types: int, float, double, long, long double, char etc are basic data types. We can convert one basic data type into aother . Ther are two types of conversions: implicit and explicit. Thus, as type conversion may either be explicit or implicit, depending on whether it is ordered by the programmer or by the compiler. See Chapt-2 for detail information about implicit and explicit type conversion.
